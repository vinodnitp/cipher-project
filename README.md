# cipher-project
We have 2 keys k1 and k2, And an unecrypted string.
k=k1 XoR k2 (k can be change through function, as function definition can be changed)
First make string encrypted by Additive cipher Algorithm.
then use Querty algorithm(q,w,e,r,t ...) to make encrypted string to make strong encryption .
Simillar process is used to decrypt the string.
